Quick Summary
====================


Nullomers are short DNA sequences (13-17 base pairs) that are absent from the human genome (17–19). While the absence of nullomers could be due to chance, we and others have shown that a significant proportion of them is under negative selection pressures (18, 19), suggesting that they could have a deleterious effect on the genome. We have also shown that these sequences could be used as DNA ‘fingerprints’ to identify specific human populations (19). As nullomers do not exist in a human genome, their appearance due to mutagenesis followed by clonal expansion could be exploited as a diagnostic method for diseases associated with a mutational burden, such as cancer.
